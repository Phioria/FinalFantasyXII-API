# FinalFantasyXII-API

This is a REST API learning project for me.
The goal is to make a public facing api for accessing data relevant to Final Fantasy XII utilizing NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB(mongoose).
Hoping to implement public facing GET routes with filtering options and private POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for DB development and maintenance.

API usage will be extensively documented here as time goes on.
